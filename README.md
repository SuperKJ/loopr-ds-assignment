4. Train the model on at least 5 different type of neural networks for image classification
5. Perform evaluation on the test set for every neural network used and compare the scores
6. Write code for inferencing the images for the best model
7. Do hyperparameter tuning if needed

### Bonus Task
1. Take any text file which is more than 10mb(large text file)
2. Write the code to efficiently read it in python with least amount of time
3. Find the most occurred word in the text file and replace it with loopr (ex if the most occurred
